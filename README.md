# Compiled Cheat Engine (x64) 7.5 DMA Plugin
Based on this repository: https://github.com/Metick/CheatEngine-DMA

## Why?
Because it's very tricky to find out how to compile it right way. 

To compile it's on your own, you have to manualy download next repositories:
1. https://github.com/ufrisk/LeechCore for **leechcore** library (You also have to download OLDER COMMIT version of repository, download whole repository on commit version **2.18.4**)
2. https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS for **vmm** library
3. https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine for **lua53-64** library
4. Compile them all in x64 Release mode with same Win10 SDK version
5. Put 3 lib files into corresponding plugin lib directories
6. Put all 3 compiled DLLs into **prepared empty folder**
7. Make changes in plugin source code to fix some minor compiler errors, it's easy
8. Compile plugin in Release x64
9. Put compiled **plugin.dll** file into **prepared folder** with those 3 DLLs.
10. Now copy all 4 files from **prepared folder** to CE 7.5 directory, say **Yes** to replace lua53-64.dll
11. Launch Cheat Engine 7.5 **x64** (not i386 !!!) and try to add your plugin. **You shouldn't have error 126.**
12. Now your added plugin will work

## Download precompiled plugin binaries
You can skip these tedious steps and simply download my precompiled plugin (the precompiled files are available in the current repository). Just place it in the CE 7.5 directory and agree to replace lua53-64.dll. It should work perfectly. Just remember to **add it to the plugin list in CE Settings and ensure it's enabled**. If it doesn't work, try installing the **MSVC 2022 x64 Runtime Redistributable** package from the official Microsoft website.

## How to check if it works
After installing and activating the plugin, a console window with logs will appear. When you open the process list in CE to attach, you will see all the processes of your DMA Host PC. If you have a DMA card connected via USB, it should be detected immediately and list all the processes of your Host PC. Thereâ€™s no need to install extra drivers or anything else; the DMA USB interface is usually Plug & Play on Windows (tested on the CaptainDMA board, works perfectly).
